# Code.gov Validator

Schema validation package for Code.gov.

This project is still a work in progress and is not ready for use. Feedback, issues, and PR are welcome. Please use the [project's issues area](https://github.com/gsa/code-gov-validator/issues) to submit any feedback or problems you might be experiencing with the project. You can also contact us directly at code@gsa.gov for any general Code.gov related inquiries.

# Why is this being worked on

Part of our effort to make the Code.gov platform more reusable and extendable is to break up our projects into smaller individual pieces. In our opinion this will help us lower the barrier to entry for external contributors and help our partners to understand and give us feedback on the platform.

# Is this a copy of some other code base

Yes it is. The base for this code base is from [code-gov-api](https://github.com/gsa/code-gov-api), specifically the [code-gov-api validator service](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-api/tree/master/services/validator).

# Roadmap for this project

1. Get it to work to [code-gov-api](https://github.com/gsa/code-gov-api) in production as a package replacement for the validator service
2. Code clean up and maybe a bit of project restructuring.
3. Create a CLI to allow manual execution on local files.
